# Time-Series Forecasting on Super Store

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for time-series forecasting on Super Store sales data in the United States.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains historical sales data of a Super Store in the United States.

## Task Description
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Perform data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, outliers, and data aggregation.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Conduct EDA to understand the patterns and trends in the sales data.

3. **Model Selection and Rationale:**
   - Implement the following time-series forecasting models:
     - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
     - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
     - Auto-ARIMA
   - Provide rationale behind selecting each model based on its suitability for the dataset and forecasting requirements.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate time-series forecasting evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize the findings from the time-series forecasting task and discuss any insights gained from the analysis.

## Files Included
- Jupyter notebook containing code for data preprocessing, EDA, model implementation, and evaluation.
- README.md (this file) providing an overview of the project.
